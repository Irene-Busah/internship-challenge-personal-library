## 💻 Intern Project: Build a Simple, Personal CRUD App

### 👋 Hey there!

We're excited that you're interested in joining us. Before we chat, we'd love for you to spend a bit of time building a small project — nothing too complex, just something that helps us understand how you think, write code, and solve problems.

**This isn’t a test.** You won’t be judged on perfection — we care more about how you approach things than whether everything works flawlessly. Be yourself, build something you enjoy, and tell us the story behind it.

### 🎯 The Challenge: A Single-Page App with CRUD

Build a small web app that lets users **Create, Read, Update, and Delete** entries for a simple model/Database Table. For example:
- Notes
- Tasks
- Books you’ve read
- Recipes
- Contacts
- Anything else you’re into — feel free to get creative!

You’ll build both a **frontend** and a **backend**:
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React)
- **Backend**: Django (with Django REST Framework)

It doesn’t have to be fancy — just functional and clear. Use whatever tools or libraries you’re comfortable with.

### 🧱 Project Requirements

#### 🔧 Backend (Django + DRF)
- One model of your choice (e.g. Task, Note, etc.)
- A simple REST API:
  - `GET`: List all entries
  - `POST`: Add a new entry
  - `PUT/PATCH`: Edit an entry
  - `DELETE`: Remove an entry

#### 💻 Frontend (Next.js)
- One page that:
  - Shows a list or table of entries
  - Includes a form to **add or update** entries
  - Allows users to **edit** or **delete** each entry

- Use `fetch`, `axios`, or anything you like to call the API.
- Clean layout > flashy design. You can use Tailwind, plain CSS, or anything you prefer.

### 🤝 What We’d Like From You

1. A link to your code (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
2. A short README with:
   - What you built and why
   - Tools and decisions you made
   - Anything that didn’t work or you’d do differently with more time

3. **Optional but appreciated**:  
   A 2–3 minute video or voice note walking us through your app and your process (think of it like showing a friend).

### 🗣️ In Our Chat

When we talk, we’ll go over:
- What you chose to build
- What parts were fun, confusing, or tricky
- How you made your decisions
- How you’d expand or improve it

We’re not looking for fancy titles or perfect code. We just want to hear how you think and what you care about when you build something.

### 🙌 Final Notes

Feel free to email us if you have any questions. When posible we will do our best to reply within 2 hours.

Looking forward to seeing what you come up with — and hearing your story when we chat!
